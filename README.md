# 3D-house-project
# Project Overview
 This project is an interactive 3D architectural view of a house developed with Three.js. It demonstrates the use of primitive geometry, advanced lighting and shading, and texture application, including textures created with POV-Ray. Users can explore the house in a first-person view, experiencing different lighting scenarios and detailed models that enhance the realism of the architectural design.

## Software Requirements
- **Node.js**: LTS version recommended. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js installation.
